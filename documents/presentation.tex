\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Model setup (revisited)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Consider the standard linear regression model:

        \begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
            y_i = \alpha_0 x_i + z_i^{\prime} \beta_0 + \epsilon_i, \quad i= 1,\ldots,n \text{where } \quad \mathbb{E}[x_i \epsilon_i] = 0, \mathbb{E}[z_i \epsilon_i] = 0
        \end{equation}

        \item<2-> $x_i$ is a (possibly missing) scalar regressor (\( m_i = \mathbbm{1}\{x_i \text{ missing}\} \)).
		\item<2-> $z_i$ contains an intercept and further instrument(s).
        \item<2-> As before, assume a linear projection of $x_i$ onto $z_i$:
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
            x_i = z_i^{\prime} \gamma_0 + \xi_i \quad \text{ where } \mathbb{E}[z_i \xi_i] = 0
        \end{equation}

        \item<3-> $\gamma_0$ determines the strength of the relationship between $x_i$ and $z_i$.
        \item<3-> Plugging equation \eqref{eq:1} into \eqref{eq:2} yields:
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
            y_i = z_i^{\prime} (\gamma_0 \alpha_0 + \beta_0) + \epsilon_i + \xi_i \alpha_0
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Dummy Variable Method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Dummy Variable Method}
	\framesubtitle{$\ldots$ and resulting problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item saw complete data, linear imputation and GMM;
		\item implementation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item replace missing data with $0$'s (or any other constant, e.g. $\bar{x}$)
			\item include dummy variable indicating missingness
		\end{itemize}
		\item down-sides:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item generally inconsistent method
			\item additional assumption of MCAR does not guarantee consistency
			\item consistency only guaranteed in implausible cases
			\item efficiency gains in comparison to complete data method not guaranteed
		\end{itemize}
		\item up-sides:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item easy to implement
			\item retain sample size
		\end{itemize}
		\item mentioned for educational purposes; not recommended for practical use
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Dummy Variable Method}
	\framesubtitle{$\ldots$ theoretical bias and inconsistency}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Imputation model \eqref{eq:2} and missing indicator $m_i$ yield:
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
            (1-m_i)x_i = (1-m_i) z_i^{\prime} \gamma_0 + (1-m_i)\xi_i
        \end{equation}

		\item<2-> Combining \eqref{eq:1} and \eqref{eq:4}:
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
            y_i = \underbrace{(1-m_i) \alpha_0 x_i + z_i^{\prime} \beta_0}_{\substack{
				y_i \text{ from \eqref{eq:1} for}\\
				\text{non-missing } (m_i = 0)\\
				x_i \text{-values}}} +
				\underbrace{m_i z_i^{\prime} \gamma_0 \alpha_0}_{\substack{
					y_i \text{ correction from \eqref{eq:2}}\\
					\text{for missing } (m_i = 1)\\
					x_i \text{-values}}} +
				\underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{\substack{
					\text{error term}\\
					\text{from } \eqref{eq:1}}} +
				\underbrace{m_i \xi_i \alpha_0}_{\substack{
					\text{error term correction}\\
					\text{for imputations in \eqref{eq:2}}}}
		\end{equation}

		\item<3-> Separating components of $z_i$, $\gamma_0$ (intercept, $\gamma_{10}$; instrument $z_{2i}$, $\gamma_{20}$):
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
			y_i = (1-m_i) \alpha_0 x_i + z_i^{\prime} \beta_0 + m_i \gamma_{10} \alpha_0 + m_i z_{2i}^{\prime} \gamma_{20} \alpha_0 + \epsilon_i + m_i \xi_i \alpha_0
		\end{equation}
		\item<4-> The dummy variable method is equivalent to running the regression without including the regressors $m_i z_{2i}^{\prime}$
		\item<4-> The estimators are $(\hat{\alpha}_{DM}, \hat{\beta}_{DM})^{\prime}$ based on running the regression in \eqref{eq:6}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Dummy Variable Method}
	\framesubtitle{$\ldots$ theoretical bias and inconsistency (continued)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> The estimators $(\hat{\alpha}_{DM}, \hat{\beta}_{DM})^{\prime}$ are biased and inconsistent, unless
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item<2-> $\alpha_0 = 0$
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<2-> $x_i$ is an irrelevant variable in the regression \eqref{eq:1}
				\item<2-> drop $x_i$ from the regression to fix missing-data problem
			\end{itemize}
			\item<3-> $\gamma_{20} = 0$
			\begin{itemize}
				\item<3-> $z_{2i}$ is not useful under imputation model \eqref{eq:2} to predict $x_i$
				\item<3-> highly unlikely in practice
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
		\item<4-> Further, efficiency gains from the dummy variable method are not guaranteed.

	\frametitle{Irrelevant variable with missing data}
	Design 2 is of high interest, as it lowers the relevance of the X's on the Y's in the large equation. That is, $\alpha_0$ is lower than in other cases. Do I need to add something regarding small gamma values here as well?

	$alpha_0 = 0.1$
