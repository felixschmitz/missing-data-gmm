  abstract = {When researchers develop new econometric methods it is common practice to compare the performance of the new methods to those of existing methods in Monte Carlo studies. The credibility of such Monte Carlo studies is often limited because of the freedom the researcher has in choosing the design. In recent years a new class of generative models emerged in the machine learning literature, termed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that can be used to systematically generate artificial data that closely mimics real economic datasets, while limiting the degrees of freedom for the researcher and optionally satisfying privacy guarantees with respect to their training data. In addition if an applied researcher is concerned with the performance of a particular statistical method on a specific data set (beyond its theoretical properties in large samples), she may wish to assess the performance, e.g., the coverage rate of confidence intervals or the bias of the estimator, using simulated data which resembles her setting. Tol illustrate these methods we apply Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to compare a number of different estimators for average treatment effects under unconfoundedness in three distinct settings (corresponding to three real data sets) and present a methodology for assessing the robustness of the results. In this example, we find that (i) there is not one estimator that outperforms the others in all three settings, so researchers should tailor their analytic approach to a given setting, and (ii) systematic simulation studies can be helpful for selecting among competing methods in this situation.},

  abstract = {Designs using planned missingness, such as the split questionnaire design, are becoming more and more important in social survey research. To ensure an acceptable questionnaire length, these approaches typically entail large amounts of planned missing data, which can be imputed after data collection. However, social surveys typically also include other types of missingness such as item nonresponse by survey participants, which need to be imputed as well. This entails a complex imputation task with amounts of missing data larger than initially planned and a potentially non-random, heterogeneous mechanism. Yet, it remains to be studied whether accurate multiple-imputation estimates can be obtained in practice with planned missingness and item nonresponse.   To deal with this research gap, we apply a Monte Carlo simulation study using real social survey data. In this study, we simulate missing data based on item nonresponse with different mechanisms and proportions of item nonresponse as well as different proportions of planned missing data. We find that item nonresponse can jeopardize the quality of estimates after multiple imputation especially when the total amount of missing data from both sources is high or when there is a considerable proportion of item nonresponse that is missing not at random. Therefore, from an imputation perspective, survey designers should incorporate their expectations about item nonresponse on each variable when designing surveys with planned missing data.},

  abstract = {A common problem in applied regression analysis is that covariate values may be missing for some observations but imputed values may be available. This situation generates a trade-off between bias and precision: the complete cases are often disarmingly few, but replacing the missing observations with the imputed values to gain precision may lead to bias. In this paper, we formalize this tradeoff by showing that one can augment the regression model with a set of auxiliary variables so as to obtain, under weak assumptions about the imputations, the same unbiased estimator of the parameters of interest as complete-case analysis. Given this augmented model, the bias-precision trade-off may then be tackled by either model reduction procedures or model averaging methods. We illustrate our approach by considering the problem of estimating the relation between income and the body mass index (BMI) using survey data affected by item non-response, where the missing values on the main covariates are filled in by imputations.},

In contrast to cross-section surveys, the imputation of missing values in panel data can profit from longitudinal information which is available for the very same observation units from other points in time. The ``row-and-column imputation procedure'' developed by Little \& Su (1989) considers longitudinal as well as cross-sectional information in the imputation process. This procedure is applied to the German Socio-Economic Panel study (SOEP) when deriving annual income variables, complemented by purely crosssectional techniques.},

Thereby, we generalise previous work on this topic which involved binary single-level and multilevel data to ordinal variables. We apply an ordered probit model with sample selection as base of our imputation algorithm. The applied model involves two equations that are modelled jointly where the first one describes the missing-data mechanism and the second one specifies the variable to be imputed. In addition, we develop a version for hierarchical data by incorporating random intercept terms in both equations. To fit this multilevel imputation model we use quadrature techniques. Two simulation studies validate the overall good performance of our single-level and multilevel imputation methods. In addition, we show its applicability to empirical data by applying it to a common research topic in educational science using data of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) and conducting a short sensitivity analysis. Our approach is designed to be used within the  software package  which makes it easy to access and apply.},

  abstract = {The statistical literature and folklore contain many methods for handling missing explanatory variable data in multiple linear regression. One such approach is to incorporate into the regression model an indicator variable for whether an explanatory variable is observed. Another approach is to stratify the model based on the range of values for an explanatory variable, with a separate stratum for those individuals in which the explanatory variable is missing. For a least squares regression analysis using either of these two missing-data approaches, the exact biases of the estimators for the regression coefficients and the residual variance are derived and reported. The complete-case analysis, in which individuals with any missing data are omitted, is also investigated theoretically and is found to be free of bias in many situations, though often wasteful of information. A numerical evaluation of the bias of two missing-indicator methods and the complete-case analysis is reported. The missing-indicator methods show unacceptably large biases in practical situations and are not advisable in general.},

Recent work on multiple imputation techniques has increased analysts? awareness of the biasing effects of missing data and has also provided a convenient solution. Imputation methods replace non-response with estimates of the unobserved scores. In many instances, however, non-response to a stimulus does not result from measurement problems that inhibit accurate surveying of empirical reality, but from the inapplicability of the survey question. In such cases, existing imputation techniques replace valid non-response with counterfactual estimates of a situation in which the stimulus is applicable to all respondents. This paper suggests an alternative imputation procedure for incomplete data for which no true score exists: multiple complete random imputation, which overcomes the biasing effects of missing data and allows analysts to model respondents? valid ?I don?t know? answers.},

Synthetic data could be sufficient for many purposes, but lingering accuracy concerns could be addressed with a validation system through which the data providers run the external researcher's code on the internal data and share cleared output with the researcher. The U.S. Census Bureau has experience running such systems. In this chapter, we first describe the role of synthetic data within a tiered data access system and the importance of synthetic data accuracy in achieving a viable synthetic data product. Next, we review results from a recent set of empirical analyses we conducted to assess accuracy in the Survey of Income \& Program Participation (SIPP) Synthetic Beta (SSB), a Census Bureau product that made linked survey-administrative data publicly available. Given this analysis and our experience working on the SSB project, we conclude with thoughts and questions regarding future implementations of synthetic data with validation.},
